## [Download](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nzZPrStvkOiiRcJ9cyDm7MCA45kJGukR/view?usp=sharing)
## Project Description
This project is a comprehensive image manipulation application designed to provide a wide range of image processing and analysis tools. The application allows users to perform various operations on images, such as conversion, filtering, morphological operations, and more, all through an intuitive graphical user interface.

## Features

- **File Operations**: 
  - Open images in color or gray scale.
  - Save images with or without compression.

- **Image Processing**:
  - Convert images to gray scale, HSV, or Lab and split channels.
  - Perform transformations like negate, stretch contrast, split channels, and duplicate images.
  - Create and manipulate histograms (create, stretch, and equalize).
  - Apply blurring effects (standard blur, Gaussian blur).
  - Execute point operations like add, subtract, blend, and logical operations (AND, OR, NOT, XOR).
  - Apply various filters including median filter and single/two stage filters.
  - Perform convolve and posterize operations.

- **Morphological Operations**:
  - Execute operations like erode, dilate, open, and close.
  - Skeletonize images.

- **Image Analysis**:
  - Use image pyramids to scale images up or down.
  - Apply Hough transform.
  - Manage profile lines and thresholding.
  - Perform inpainting, GrabCut, watershed, and other advanced analysis techniques.

- **Project-Specific Tools**:
  - Apply color image thresholding (RGB, HSV, Lab).
  - Count objects in binary maps (white and black objects).

- **User-Friendly Interface**: 
  - Easy navigation through different image processing and analysis tools.
  - Real-time updates on selected images and operations.
